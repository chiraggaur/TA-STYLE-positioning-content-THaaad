                <h2> COFFE LATTE</h2>
                <P>
                    The two most popular drinks are the cappuccino and the latte. <br>
                    Latte can mean many things though! Cappuccino is usually a mixture <br>
                    of espresso, milk and foam. Some say it's a third of each. Personally <br>
                    I think that doesn't add up as most people will serve cappuccino in at least <br>
                    a 6oz cup which means it would have 2oz of espresso, quite strong.<br>
                    A 12oz cappuccino would then have 4oz of espresso.
